  <p>The <b class = "place">India Gate</b>, (originally
    called the <b>All India War Memorial</b>), is a war memorial located astride the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajpath">Rajpath</a>, on the eastern edge of the <i>‘ceremonial axis’</i> of New Delhi, India,
    formerly called Kingsway.
   </p>

  <p>India Gate is a memorial to
    82,000 soldiers of the <b>Indian Army</b> who died in the period <time>1914–21</time> in the
    First World War, in France, <i lang="fr">Flanders</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i>, <i>Persia</i>, <i>East Africa</i>,
    <i lang="tr">Gallipoli</i> and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third
    Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and
    officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.The India
    Gate, even though a war memorial, evokes the architectural style of the
    triumphal arch like the Arch of Constantine, outside the Colosseum in Rome,
    and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of
    India in Mumbai. It was designed by <b class="person">Sir Edwin Lutyens</b>.
  </p>

<p>In <time>1971</time>, following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War">Bangladesh
  Liberation war</a>, a small simple structure, consisting of a black marble
  plinth, with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet, bounded by four eternal
  flames, was built beneath the soaring Memorial Archway. This structure, called
  Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the Flame of the Immortal Soldier, since <time>1971</time> has served
  as India's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a>. India Gate is counted among the
  largest war memorials in India
