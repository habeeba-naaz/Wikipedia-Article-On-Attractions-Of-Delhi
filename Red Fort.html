  <p>The <strong>Red Fort</strong> is a historical
    fort in the city of Delhi in India. It was the main residence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_emperors#List_of_Mughal_Emperors" target="_blank">emperors</a>
    of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" target="_blank">Mughal dynasty</a> for nearly 200 years, until 1857. It is located in the
    center of Delhi and houses a number of museums. In addition to accommodating
    the emperors and their households, it was the ceremonial and political centre
    of the Mughal state and the setting for events critically impacting the region.
   </p>

  <p>Constructed in <time>1639</time> by the fifth
    Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as the palace of his fortified capital Shahjahanabad,
    the Red Fort is named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone and is
    adjacent to the older Salimgarh Fort, built by Islam Shah Suri in <time>1546</time>. The
    imperial apartments consist of a row of pavilions, connected by a water channel
    known as the Stream of Paradise (<i>Nahr-i-Bihisht</i>). The fort complex is considered
    to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity under Shah Jahan,
    and although the palace was planned according to Islamic prototypes, each
    pavilion contains architectural elements typical of Mughal buildings that
    reflect a fusion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_dynasty#Timurid_architecture" target="_blank">Timurid</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_architecture" target="_blank">Persian</a> traditions. The Red Fortâ€™s innovative
    architectural style, including its garden design, influenced later buildings
    and gardens in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Kashmir, Braj, Rohilkhand and elsewhere.
  </p>

<p>The fort was plundered of its
  artwork and jewels during <b>Nadir Shah's</b> invasion of the Mughal Empire in <time>1747</time>.
  Most of the fort's precious marble structures were subsequently destroyed by the
  British following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857" target="_blank">Sepoy Mutiny</a> of 1857.The forts's defensive walls were
  largely spared, and the fortress was subsequently used as a <b>garrison</b>. The
  Red Fort was also the site where the British put the last Mughal Emperor on
  trial before exiling him to Rangoon in <time>1858</time>.
</p>

<p>Every year on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(India)" target="_blank">Independence day</a>
  of India (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian "tricolour flag"
  at the main gate of the fort and delivers a nationally-broadcast speech from
  its ramparts.
</p>

<p>It was designated a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" target="_blank">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.
