   <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;">The Mughal Gardens are situated
     at the back of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, incorporate both Mughal and English
     landscaping styles and feature a great variety of flowers. The Rashtrapati
     Bhavan gardens are open to the public in February every year.
   </p>
   <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;"><b>Main garden:</b> Two channels
     running North to South and two running East to West divide this garden into
     a grid of squares. There are six lotus shaped fountains at the crossings of these channels.
     Whereas the energetic fountains rising up to a height of 12 feet (3.7 m) create
     a soothing murmur that enthralls the visitor, the channels are so tranquil in
     their movement that they seem frozen. In the channels at appropriate times of
     day can be seen reflections of the imposing building and the proud flowers.
     There are wooden trays placed on stands in the centre of the channels where
     grain is put for the birds to feed upon.
   </p>
   <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;"><b>Terrace garden:</b> There are two
     longitudinal strips of garden, at a higher level on each side of the Main
     Garden, forming the Northern and Southern boundaries. The plants grown are
     the same as in the Main Garden. At the centre of both of the strips is a fountain,
     which falls inwards, forming a well. On the Western tips are located two gazebos
     and on the Eastern tips two ornately designed sentry posts.
   </p>
   <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;"><b>Long Garden or the 'Purdha Garden':</b>
     This is located to the West of the Main Garden, and runs along on each side
     of the central pavement which goes to the circular garden. Enclosed in walls
     about 12 feet high, this is predominantly a rose garden. It has 16 square
     rose beds encased in low hedges. There is a red sandstone pergola in the
     centre over the central pavement which is covered with Rose creepers, Petrea,
     Bougainvillea and Grape Vines. The walls are covered with creepers like Jasmine,
     Rhyncospermum, Tecoma Grandiflora, Bignonia Vanista, Adenoclyma, Echitice,
     Parana Paniculata. Along the walls are planted the China Orange trees.
   </p>
   <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;">Around the circular garden
     there are rooms for the office of the horticulturist, a green house, stores,
     nursery etc. Here is housed the collection of Bonsais, one of the best in the country.
   </p>
   <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;">All the presidents who have stayed
     at the Rashtrapati Bhavan have taken a keen interest in the maintenance and
     upkeep of the Mughal Gardens. All have contributed in their own way.
     The underlying themes, however, have remained unaltered.
