  <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;"><strong>Qutub Minar</strong> is a minaret that forms part of the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_complex">Qutb complex</a>,
     a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO"><abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">World Heritage Site</a> in the Mehrauli area of Delhi,
     India.Made of red sandstone and marble, Qutub Minar
     is a 73 <abbr aria-label ="metres">mt</abbr> (240 <abbr aria-label ="feet">ft</abbr>) tall tapering tower of five storeys,
     with a 14.3 <abbr aria-label ="metres">mt</abbr> (47 <abbr aria-label ="feet">ft</abbr>) base diameter,
     reducing to 2.7 <abbr aria-label ="metres">mt</abbr> (9 <abbr aria-label ="feet">ft</abbr>) at the peak.
     It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps.
     Its design is thought to have been based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minaret_of_Jam">Minaret of Jam</a>,
     in western Afghanistan.

  <p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;"><b class ="person">Qutb Ud-Din-Aibak</b>, founder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>,
    started construction of the Qutub Minar's first storey around <time>1192</time>.
    In <time>1220</time>, Aibak's successor and son-in-law <b class="person">Iltutmish</b> completed a further
    three storeys. In <time>1369<time>, a lightning strike destroyed the top storey.
    <b class="person">Firoz Shah Tughlaq</b> replaced the damaged storey, and added one more.
  </p>

<p style ="font-family:Georgia;font-size:150%;">The Minar is surrounded by several historically significant monuments
  of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_complex">Qutb complex</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutb_complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam_Mosque">Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque</a>,
  which was built at the same time as the Minar, and the much older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pillar_of_Delhi">Iron
  Pillar of Delhi</a>.The nearby pillared Cupola known as <i>"Smith's Folly"</i>
  is a remnant of the tower's 19th century restoration, which included an
  ill-advised attempt to add a sixth storey.
